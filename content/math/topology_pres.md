Summary: I gave a talk at the [NCSU Linux Users' Group](http://lug.ncsu.edu/) on some ideas about mechanics, spatial dimensions, data science, and differential geometry. Slides and video after the break.

Yesterday I gave a talk at the [NCSU Linux Users' Group](http://lug.ncsu.edu) and I've posted the slides and a video here. Not captured in the audio was, after the talk, an impromptu lecture about Hilbert's infinite hotel and then [Jim Witschey](http://twitter.com/mambocab) came up to talk about the expectation of the Poisson distribution. So it was a good time!

Here's the original abstract of the talk:

> YOUR FOOD IS ALWAYS OUTSIDE OF YOU

> (Some Ideas About Space But Definitely Not Time)
> 
> ABSTRACT:
> 
> I'm going to, in an accessible way, cover some mathematical and physical ideas that I think are important or at least pretty cool. (CHILL. OUT.) You probably spent a lot of time in grade school factoring polynomials or whatever. I don't care about that. I want to talk about why orbits work, what happens in 5-D, why the World Series is slightly better than a coin toss, databases are broken forever, truth itself is wrong, and what happens if an infinite number of buses roll up at your house. Or some subset of that.

> I'll cover three or four discrete topics, so don't worry if you get lost; you'll be following along again in a few slides. Any equations will be supplementary only- you won't have to understand them to get the general idea.
