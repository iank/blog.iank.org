Summary: I picked a Mul-T-Lock Interactive, a high-security pin-in-pin dimple lock.

The other day I picked a [Mul-T-Lock Interactive](http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Mul-T-Lock_Interactive) key-in-knob cylinder that a locksmith gave me from his scrap bucket. That feels like an accomplishment to me, hence this otherwise empty post. This morning I even managed to repeat the pick and gut process on video, although I shot the video in a vertical configuration from a bad angle and it's spectacularly boring.

I have one thought to contribute: the interactive element intimidated me when I first learned about it, but I realize now it is mostly a key control feature as it does not substantially impact picking (vs a Mul-T-Lock classic).
